\section*{\textbf{Abstract}}

Stock price prediction is a complex yet crucial problem in the field of financial analytics, characterized by high volatility, non-linearity, and temporal dependencies. With the growing importance of intelligent trading systems, the integration of advanced deep learning methods with traditional statistical models has emerged as a promising direction. This dissertation presents a comprehensive study on stock price forecasting using a series of novel hybrid architectures that leverage both data-driven learning and time-series modeling techniques.\\

The research explores and compares multiple predictive frameworks, including a baseline Hybrid LSTM-RLS architecture, an Enhanced Hybrid LSTM-RLS model with multi-feature input sequences, a Dual Network Solution (DNS) integrating diverse temporal patterns, and a residual-based ARIMAX-LSTM integration framework. Additionally, a GARCH model is incorporated to capture the conditional heteroskedasticity of financial time series, further enhancing prediction reliability. Feature engineering, input sequence optimization, and performance refinement are key components of the experimental setup.\\

The models are trained and tested on historical stock market data, and evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results demonstrate that the Enhanced Hybrid LSTM-RLS and ARIMAX-LSTM Residual Integration architectures outperform other models in terms of predictive accuracy and stability. Furthermore, the application of Recursive Least Squares (RLS) significantly improves model adaptability and responsiveness to recent market trends.\\

This work contributes to the field by proposing scalable, interpretable, and performance-driven models for time series forecasting in finance. The insights gained from this study can aid in the development of more effective decision-support systems for investors and financial analysts.\\
