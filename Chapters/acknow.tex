\section*{\textcolor{internationalkleinblue}{\textbf{Acknowledgment}}}
While the student's name appears as the sole contributor to this internship report, it is essential to acknowledge that its completion was made possible through the collaborative efforts and guidance of several key individuals. I extend my deepest gratitude to Dr. Jigarkumar Shah, my internal guide from Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), for his steadfast support and insightful feedback, which were crucial in refining my approach and achieving my project goals. I am also profoundly thankful to Dr. Bhubon Chandra Mech, my external guide at the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), for his invaluable mentorship, which was instrumental in shaping my project and enhancing my understanding of integrating AI techniques into financial signal processing. Additionally, my sincere appreciation goes to Dr. Mohendra Roy from PDEU for facilitating this internship opportunity, and to the Hostel Management Committee (HMC) at DIAT for providing a comfortable and conducive environment for my work. This internship has been an immensely educational and rewarding experience, and I am deeply appreciative of the guidance and support from all my mentors.
